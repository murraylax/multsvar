  annote="They estimate multipliers with a simple regression model on annual U.S. data, taking careful account of the endogeneity problem.  For government spending, they use defense purchases and find multipliers equal to about 0.4-0.5.  They take advantage of significant variability in defense purchases during WWI, WWII, and the Korean War, and they account for the crowding out of non-defense government spending.  For perceived "permanent" changes in government spending (measured using Ramey's (2009) defense news variable), multipliers are larger by about 0.1-0.2.  The authors look at taxes with a constructed measure for the average marginal tax rate (AMTR) (constructed using the AMTR that would exist under the previous year's income, to account for the endogeneity problem).  They also use Romer and Romer's (2009) exogenous tax variable to measure the multiplier due to the income effect.  They find a tax multiplier in a magnitude greater than one (-1.1), and due mostly to the substitution effects (labor/leisure).  Given the magnitudes of the government spending and tax multipliers, they suggest a balanced budget multiplier is likely negative.

This is worth citing to note the magnitude of multipliers, the identification strategies, and especially the effects that the preception of permanence has on government spending multipliers."
